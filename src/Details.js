  about: `Hello! I'm a 39-year-old enthusiast of frontend development, currently
  studying in HyperIsland in Stockholm, Sweden. im really enjoying the
  challenge of coding and the small eureka moments every time you solve a
  problem! When I'm not crafting pixel-perfect interfaces, you can find me
  in the gym honing my skills in kickboxing. While kickboxing challenges
  you to dodge punches, coding throws bugs your way. I'm passionate about
  creating engaging user experiences and constantly seek to expand my
  knowledge in the ever-evolving field of technology. Let's connect in
  coding or in the ring and share our journey in the world of development!`,
